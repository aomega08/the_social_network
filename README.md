The Social Network
================

This application aims to be a clone of a very famous social network. This is mainly for educational pourposes, but you're free to take it and, using it's vast logic, build your _next big thing_. And if you get rich with it, just buy me a beer or two.

Problems? Issues?
-----------------

This is going to be an extremely large application, so problems are expected. 

Right now I'm a solo developer and I can give few hours per week to the project, so I will skip testing just to get rich faster. If you would like to contribute with tests or bug fixes, please DO.

Dependencies
-------------

This application requires the latest versions of Ruby and Rails which at the time are:

- Ruby 2.1.2
- Rails 4.1.4

PostgreSQL is used as production storage, so that you can push to Heroku in seconds. **However** many dependencies are expected to arise in the future (Twilio? Hadoop? Cassandra?). Well, maybe.

Getting Started
---------------

Write a config/database.yml with your connection parameters, run the migrations and you're ready to roll.
